{\bf Definition}:  An integer $p$ greater than $1$ is called {\bf prime} means 
the only positive factors of 
$p$ are $1$ and $p$. A positive integer that is greater than $1$ and is not prime 
is called composite. \\

A formal definition of the predicate $Pr$ over the domain $\mathbb{Z}$ 
which evaluates to T exactly when evaluated on a prime integer is:
\[
    (x > 1) \land \forall a( ~ (~ a > 0 \land F(a,x) ~) \to (a = 1 \lor a = x) ~)
\]
