{\bf Example predicates on $S$, the set of RNA strands (an infinite set)}


$H: S \to \{T, F\}$ where $H(s) = T$ for all $s$.

Truth set of $H$ is \underline{\phantom{$S$\hspace{1in}}}\\

$F_{\A}: S \to \{T, F\}$  defined recursively by: 

~~Basis step: $F_{\A}(\A) = T$, $F_{\A}(\C) = F_{\A}(\G) = F_{\A}(\U) = F$

~~Recursive step: If $s \in S$ and $b \in B$, then $F_{\A}(sb) = F_{\A}(s)$.

Strand where $F_{\A}$ evaluates to $T$ is e.g.\underline{\phantom{$\A\C\G$~\hspace{0.3in}}}

Strand where $F_{\A}$ evaluates to $F$ is e.g. \underline{\phantom{$\U\A\C\U$\hspace{0.3in}}}\\

$P_{\A\U\C}$ is defined as the predicate whose truth set
is the collection of RNA strands where the string $\A\U\C$
is a substring (appears inside $s$, in order and consecutively)

Strand where $P_{\A\U\C}$ evaluates to $T$ is e.g.\underline{\phantom{$\A\A\A$~\hspace{0.3in}}}

Strand where $P_{\A\U\C}$ evaluates to $F$ is e.g. \underline{\phantom{$\A\A\U\A$\hspace{0.3in}}}\\
