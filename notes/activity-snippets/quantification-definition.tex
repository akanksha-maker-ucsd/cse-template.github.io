{\bf Definitions}:

The {\bf universal quantification} of $P(x)$ is the statement ``$P(x)$ for all values of $x$ in the domain''
and is written $\forall x P(x)$. An element for which $P(x) = F$ is called a {\bf counterexample} of $\forall x P(x)$.

The {\bf existential quantification} of $P(x)$ is the statement ``There exists an element $x$ in the domain such that $P(x)$'' and is written $\exists x P(x)$. An element for which $P(x) = T$ is called a {\bf witness} of $\exists x P(x)$.
