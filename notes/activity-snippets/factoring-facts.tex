Some useful facts about integers and factoring:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When $a, b$ are positive integers, $a | b$ guarantees $a \leq b$.
\item When $a$ is a positive integer and $b$ is any integer, $a | b$
exactly when $b \textbf{ mod } a = 0$
\item When $a$ is a positive integer and $b$ is any integer, $a | b$
exactly $b = a \cdot (b \textbf{ div } a)$
\item Real number arithmetic: addition and multiplication of real 
 numbers are each commutative and associative, the set of integers
 is closed under addition, multiplication, and subtraction, 
 for every integer $x$ there is no integer strictly between $x$ and $x+1$, 
 the product of two negative numbers is positive and the product of two 
 positive numbers is positive.
\end{enumerate}

{\it Extra example}: write each of the facts above symbolically using 
quantifiers and logical operators.
