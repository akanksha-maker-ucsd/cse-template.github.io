In class, we proved the theorem that: 
Every positive integer is a sum of (one or more) distinct powers of $2$. {\it  
binary expansions exist!}

What's wrong with the following {\it attempted} proof of this fact?


{\bf Attempted proof by mathematical induction}, with $b=1$.

{\bf Basis step}: WTS $1$ can be written 
as a sum of (one or more) distinct powers of $2$. Since $1 =2^0$, 
we are done.

{\bf Recursive step}: Consider an arbitrary integer $n \geq 1$.
By the IH, we can write $n$ as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.
Since $1 = 2^0$, it is a power of $2$ and we can add it as a term 
to this sum of powers of $2$. When we do so, the terms sum to $n+1$
and we are done.
