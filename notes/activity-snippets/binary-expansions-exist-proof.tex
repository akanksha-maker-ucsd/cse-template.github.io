{\bf Theorem}: Every positive integer is a sum of (one or more) distinct powers of $2$.
{\it binary expansions exist!}

Recall the definition for binary expansion:

\input{../activity-snippets/base-expansion-binary.tex}


The idea in the ``Least significant first" algorithm 
for computing binary expansions is that the binary
expansion of $n \textbf{ div } 2$ forms part of the binary expansion of $n$. We can use this 
idea in a proof by strong induction that binary expansions exist for all 
positive integers $n$.

\newpage

{\bf Proof by strong induction}, with $b=1$ and $j=0$.


{\bf Basis step}:  WTS property is true about  $1$.

\phantom{Choose $a_0 = 1$, then $(a_0)_2 = 1 \cdot 2^0 = 1$.}

{\bf Recursive step}: Consider an arbitrary integer $n \geq 1$.
Assume (as the IH) that the property is true about  each of $1, \ldots, n$.  

WTS that the property is true about $n+1$.

{\it Idea}: We will apply the IH to $(n+1) \textbf{ div } 2$.

{\it Why is this ok?}

\phantom{Notice that $(n+1) \textbf{ div } 2$ is greater than or equal to 
$1$ and less than or equal to $n$ because $n \geq 1$.}


{\it Why is this helpful?}

The IH gives $a_{k-1}, \ldots, a_0$ such that each $a_i$ is $0$ or $1$, $a_{k-1} = 1$, 
and $\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i = (n+1) \textbf{ div } 2$. Consider the sequence of 
coefficients
$c_{i} = a_{i-1}$ for $i$ between $1$ and $k$, and $c_0 = (n+1) \textbf{ mod } 2$.
Then $\sum_{i=0}^k c_i = 2 \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i + c_0 = n+1$.
