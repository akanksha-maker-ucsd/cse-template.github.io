{\bf Claim}: The statement ``There are three consecutive positive integers that are prime." is True / False 

{\it Hint}: These numbers would be of the form $p, p+1, p+2$ (where $p$ is a positive integer).

{\bf Proof}: We need to show \underline{\phantom{$\exists p \in \mathbb{Z}^+ ~(~Pr(p) \land Pr(p+1) \land Pr(p+2)~)$}}

{\bf Claim}: The statement ``There are three consecutive odd positive integers that are prime." is True / False 

{\it Hint}: These numbers would be of the form $p, p+2, p+4$ (where $p$ is an odd positive integer).

{\bf Proof}: We need to show \underline{\phantom{$\exists p \in \mathbb{Z}^+ ~(~(p \textbf{ mod } 2 = 1 \land Pr(p) \land Pr(p+2) \land Pr(p+4)~)$}}
