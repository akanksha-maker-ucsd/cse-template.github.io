{\bf Claim}: For each  $a \in U$, $[a]_{E}  \neq  \emptyset$.

{\bf Proof}: Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$ 
consider an arbitrary element $a$ in $U$. 
We will work to show that $[a]_E \neq \emptyset$, namely that $\exists x \in [a]_E$.
By definition of equivalence classes, we can rewrite this goal as 
$\exists x \in U ~( ~(a,x) \in E~)$. 
Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$, consider $x = a$, 
an element of $U$ by definition. By $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$ of $E$, 
we know that $(a,a) \in E$  and thus the existential quantification has been proved.

{\bf Claim}: For each $a \in U$, there is some $b \in U$  such that $a \in [b]_{E}$.

Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$ 
consider an arbitrary element $a$ in $U$. By definition of equivalence classes, 
we can rewrite the goal as 
$\exists b \in U ~( ~(b,a) \in E~)$. 
Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$, consider $b = a$, 
an element of $U$ by definition. By $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$  of $E$, 
we know that $(a,a) \in E$  and thus the existential quantification has been proved.

{\bf Claim}: For each  $a,b  \in U$ , $(~(a,b)  \in  E ~)\to (~ [a]_{E}  = [b]_{E}~)$
and  $(~(a,b)  \notin  E ~)\to (~ [a]_{E} \cap[b]_{E} = \emptyset~)$

{\bf Corollary}: Given an equivalence relation $E$ on set $U$,  $\{ [x]_{E} \mid x \in U  \}$ is a partition of $U$.
