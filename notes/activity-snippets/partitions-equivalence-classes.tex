{\bf Fact}: When $R$ is an equivalence relation on a nonempty set $A$, 
the collection of equivalence classes of $R$ is a partition of $A$.

Also, given a partition $P$ of $A$, the relation $R_P$ on $A$ given by 
\[
    \{ (x,y) \in A \times A ~|~ \text{$x$ and $y$ are in the same part of the partition $R_P$}\}
\]
is an equivalence relation on $A$.
