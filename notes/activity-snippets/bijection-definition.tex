{\bf Definition} : A function $f: D  \to C$ is a {\bf bijection} means that it is both  one-to-one  and onto.
The {\bf inverse} of a  bijection $f: D  \to  C$ is  the function $g: C  \to  D$  such that $g(b) = a$ iff  $f(a) =  b$.

For nonempty sets $A, B$ we say
\begin{align*}
|A| \leq |B| &\text{ means there is a one-to-one function with domain $A$, codomain $B$} \\

|A| = |B| &\text{ means there is a bijection with domain $A$, codomain $B$}
