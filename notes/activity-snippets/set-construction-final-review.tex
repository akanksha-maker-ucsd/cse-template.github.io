The bases of RNA strands are elements of the set $B = \{\A, \C, \G, \U \}$. 
Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation. Rewrite them using the roster method. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{s \in S ~|~ s \text{ has length $2$} \}$ 

\vfill

\item $\{s \in S ~|~ \text{the leftmost base in $s$ is the same as the rightmost base in $s$ and 
$s$ has length $3$} \}$ 

\vfill

\item $\{s \in S ~|~ \text{there are twice as many $\A$s as $\C$s in $s$ and $s$ has length $1$} \}$ 

\vfill

\end{itemize}

Certain 
 sequences of bases serve important biological functions in translating RNA to proteins. The following
 recursive definition gives a special set of RNA strands: The set of RNA strands $\hat{S}$ is defined (recursively)
 by 
 
 \begin{alignat*}{2}
\text{Basis step:} & & \A\U\G \in \hat{S}\\
\text{Basis step:} & \qquad& \text{If } s \in \hat{S} \text{ and } x \in R \text{, then } sx\in \hat{S}\\
 \end{alignat*}
 where $R = \{ \U\U\U, \C\U\C, \A\U\C, \A\U\G, \G\U\U, \C\C\U, \G\C\U, \U\G\G, \G\G\A \}$.

Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation. Rewrite them using the roster method. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{s \in \hat{S} ~|~ s \text{ has length less than or equal to $5$} \}$ 

\vfill


\item $\{s \in S ~|~ \text{there are twice as many $\C$s as $\A$s in $s$ and $s$ has length $6$} \}$ 

\vfill

\end{itemize}
