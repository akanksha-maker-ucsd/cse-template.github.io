{\bf Definition} : A function $f: D  \to C$ is {\bf one-to-one} (or  injective) means for every $a,b$ in the domain $D$, 
if $f(a) = f(b)$ then  $a=b$.

{\bf Definition}:  For sets $A, B$, we say that  {\bf the  cardinality of $A$ is  no  bigger than the cardinality of  $B$}, and 
write $|A| \leq |B|$, to mean there is a  one-to-one function  with domain $A$  and codomain $B$.
